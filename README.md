6.Reflections
I learned how to integrate software and hardware to serve my design goals. In this process, I completed various developments I was not particularly skilled at before, such as voice-to-text, real-time data transmission, and database design. However, the final result met my expectations. If I had more time, I would like to further refine the functionalities, such as distinguishing different speakers by their voice tones, and presenting more useful information on the web page.
