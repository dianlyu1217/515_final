"User: So typically, like currently here, I'll just buy based on my experience. Okay, so I'm glad you can never have routine. Because the, you know, the mind is the way it is, it is. So early, so I think you guys are working on the early onset. So early onset is usually involves a lot of confusion and a lot of forgetfulness. You know, and, you know, what time is the oldest be asked, What time is it? What time is it? You know, what time is it, they'll forget their meals time, forget, you know, whether it's the shower time, or whatever it is. So from a caregiver point of view, what you want is to kind of create a routine for them. So there, but you also have to have an understanding of the type of personality they have. So, you know, just like you, and IV are people who are morning, people and those who are not morning people. So you just have to know who is who. Because if you try to get a morning, one who's not a morning person to up too early, then you you're setting yourself up for failure in that they'll be agitated, there'll be a you know, pissed off all shift long. So why not greater than to create a schedule that works based on each individual? person. So you've established that James is a morning person. So you're going, what really helps is just having just having an understanding of how they want to be, helps those who are who feel, especially early on, and they also feel I can do this, I don't need the help. So your approach has to be more of suggestion, hey, you know, do you want to put on your red shirt today? Or do you want to put you know, this one looks good on you. So how you approach the care side, you know, goes a long way. Those who are very okay with you helping them, you know, and let's make make life way easier. But your goal is to one, establish also an independence for them, allow them to be as independent as possible, let them do as much as they can, by themselves. So you do more of a supporting role. And for those that you have total care for, you have to have that understanding of the different personality that they have. So you find that most of the time families come in, oh, no, my mom is ABCD. But your experience as a caregiver is totally different. Because now Alzheimer's dementia creates like a totally different personality than those who used to be very nice. That change it also be who used to be very horrible. And you know, and sometimes families will be like, Oh, you don't know my, my dad, James, or you don't know my mom. But that's, that's, that's the difference of personality. So a caregiver needs to have a better understanding of who that person is. And what they have, especially we're doing going through the changes. A challenge for early onset Alzheimer's is that we are times where everything is okay. And normal, I don't I don't know, for lack of better word, they're normal. Like they, you know, everything's everything is clicking, they know themselves. They know what's going on. And then there'll be days when the, you know, the Alzheimer's has kicked in, especially for the early onset. And that's usually tough to predict. It's really tough to predict from the caregiver, you know, what's How do you predict the care that we provide, or the assistance that that you provide? Because two days, three days, James is fine, then the next day, he's wandered out of the building or something like that for",Need/Expectations,,
"So that's, that's usually it's usually a rough period, where in sometimes when they go to see the doctor, it just happens to be the one day when everything is clicking, and therefore the doctor does not see what you're, you know, what you're seeing are the changes. And then we have days where I, you know, my mom or dad is so confused.",Pain point,,
"The communication mainly has to come from the nursing teams. Because they'll say, if there's a change, you know, we call your change of condition. So, you know, if something happened, Jim's walked out of the building today. So that we have to report that to the doctor just whatever incident it is, let the doctor know. Or sometimes incontinence becomes a problem is more confusion, they went to the dining room, I cannot tell what meal I want to have today, those kind of things. So we have to report those things so that the doctor is more informed. And the more information they have, they're able to do the diagnosis and know and know what, you know if this medication, or whatever it is that they need to help out with. I do know they're working on some medication, too, for those who are early onset to kind of slow down the process. I honestly don't know if it does help or it doesn't. Yeah, I think it's still early studies on that. So",scenario（when/how/who/where/frequency）,Functionality/Features,
"We do have to track you do have. So for example, if I go see my doctor gets, the doctor will give us instructions. They'll say, Please monitor for aggression, Please monitor for confusion, Please monitor for, you know, if ABCD happens, please, you know, report that back to us. And so we do track, we do trucking everyday, the kid stuff every shift will right? If something happened or something didn't happen. That's all well and good. But then isn't it? Yeah,",Functionality/Features,scenario（when/how/who/where/frequency）,
"We for us, we use what is called Point Click care. There's a software point, click care. So PCC, and there, you're able to the caregiver, there are tasks that the nurse has put in. So how much do they eat, what percentage they eat? Do they were they able to do their own dressing, they use the bathroom by themselves was there was there incontinence, all those things, that behaviours, aggression, were they to quiet confusion, those things. So these are we use it, that's what we use to track it down until the nurse the RN, hi, we'll set that up. So the software comes up on the Tablets of the US that it will be able to see. So for James, this is what we need to do. And if there are any, so it like it only says, say for example, James is independent is in the bathroom. But the last two shifts, we've had to, you know, he sold himself. And we have to change that. So they report that they put that on the software, it comes to the night and then and so give the report to the doctor.",Functionality/Features,scenario（when/how/who/where/frequency）,
"Everybody who saw like for us who everybody goes, especially when it's memory everybody has to be tracked has to be like there has to be a chart, there's a form, you have to show that you're taking care of that person you're monitoring Harvey and doing because now they get to that level where they depend more on the care team than on themselves. So that's every shift the the date the instructions and tasks for them to do.",scenario（when/how/who/where/frequency）,,
"Know, I think what is most important is that is missing is that it is too it's good for the nurses. But it's not intuitive for the caregiver. Because I feel like so let me go you got yourself on our it's on the top, you need to make it easy for the caregiver, to be able to put in the data that you want, the way we have it set up, I think it's a little bit too complicated. For them, like by the time you get to the by the time you get to, you know, this is James, these are the tasks and this is what you know, and how to input the data data of what you find today. I feel it could be more user friendly. So that, you know, for the most part caregivers and not very, not everybody but for the most part, they're not very academically or they're not very educated, you know? So they just have that instinct of being knowing how to care for a person and taking care of a person. So when you have too much technology for them, then then they have to figure out how to get to that level. Then you want no they either. Do not give you the exact record that you want. because it's too much too cumbersome for them to get to. So you're not getting something that's accurate. And then you're also adding more tasks that you're adding to them that they don't necessarily see you know it. So you want to make it more user friendly. So I feel that's that's.",Functionality/Features,Pain point,Need/Expectations
"So yeah, so we, we always ask them to clarify. You know, please make it as simple as possible, you know, and sometimes they'll break it down. Sometimes it'll make it so much easier, so that anybody, not necessarily very highly trained can be able to read and understand what is expected and be able to put that in there. There has to be constant communication with the doctor. As far as somebody's progress is concerned.",Need/Expectations,,
"Yes. So we have to so everybody, the way we are set up here, everybody has the kind of their own personal doctor. So it's each and everybody has their own doctor that we communicate with on as needed basis on a daily basis to try and improve the care, you know, and to improve what you do for the for the particular resident.",scenario（when/how/who/where/frequency）,,
"User: Um, I think that generally, Alzheimer's, dementia is still not understood by many even like for doctors. And so what happens is, say, for example, I have Alzheimer's, dementia, and I have a fall or whatever. So I have to go to the ER. So if I go to the ER, of course, because I have the cognitive issues, I might not be able to explain exactly what happens sometimes they don't even know why, why they're there. Other than Oh, when I move my hand, you know, and sometimes they will. And I understand that, so they're trying to respect somebody's decision in the hospital. But some third person has an Alzheimer's, dementia, and they'll send them back without necessarily providing them with the treatment that they need. And I had experienced that a lot in this America, it was 100% memory care, and this be a lot of that. So we always had to keep calling the ER, know that. So Intel has a let me explain. Let me explain what's going on that kind of stuff. So I think it's not that the there is no support. I feel like it's not fully understood. Yes. Yeah, I feel like this not so like the ER for the most part they deal with, you know, people who have cognitive people are able to express themselves, then suddenly have somebody who is not able to express themselves, they just repeating the same words or that kind of stuff. So I just feel it's not fully understood. And if it was fully understood it then it will be easier to provide the care that they have. So the one thing that they started that I thought was best. I forget the name of the programme, but instead of sending someone to the ER, you they're they're called dispatch healthier dispatch health dispatcher, so instead of you taking that person to the they come in to check on that person, they're able to do lab work, are they able to do a check for urine for UTIs were able to prescribe antibiotics, those kind of things. To me, I felt that is the greatest best decision ever. So that the one they're asked caregivers and know that person much better so when they come in, we can say so James is actually very happy. But today, he looks very sad. You know, this is the change that we see. So I think I think that was the best thing they ever did to have them come to us, instead of us taking them to the to the hospitals and stuff. Yes. Yeah. And so that was more of a at, you know, from a technology point of view, they'll come in and put in all the records and stuff are able to print out what they need, how they're doing. It's easy, it just makes it way easier for everyone to take care of a person.",Pain point,scenario（when/how/who/where/frequency）,attitude（positive/negative）

"So the, it will go a long way. So they will help create create more independence. So say I have some families here who have set up, like reminders, Mom, it's time to go take your pills, or, you know, it's 7am to get built to get pills. So the they're using Alexa for that, or, you know, as some type of clock format to be able to do that. I think AI especially with the way how fast things are going, it can be able to help. Remember, they started talking about routine, it can help set up that routine for for them so that everything is as normal as well, it's time to wake up, it's time to do you know, just help set up that routine one to it's able to be able to predict or predict, let's say predict, yeah. Anticipate something that could be coming. For dementia residents. There's still so unpredictable, you know, especially early onset. As soon as the patient themselves they're so unpredictable in that they're also going through changes, like three months difference of three months is like two different people. You know, so we have like a resident who, like just within one year was going out on how walks by herself and stuff. But right now it needs almost, you know, total care, just because nothing is making sense anymore. And you take her down for lunch and she's like, Oh, no, this is breakfast, you know, that kind of stuff. So I can help. To me, I think that's routine part of things. The medication part of things. No, did you take your meds and stuff, I think that will be will go a long way to set up a resident for more independence before they have to actually have like your own caregiver. And I think most of them do, like being independent. Like that feeling of I'm doing this by myself. Yeah. But later, Alzheimers, what can AI help? I don't know yet. Yeah.",Functionality/Features,Need/Expectations,scenario（when/how/who/where/frequency）
"So after COVID That's when you started doing a lot of telehealth and zoom and all those things which was perfect for everybody but for the elder population, you know, still like a new device and they're still not sure what they they you know, who are they talking to? You know, are they looking up or down or those kind of things so if you guys are to develop something I think make it as easy as possible for them while they do not have you know, very technologies they do not have to press and do you know click to the next page those kind of things. So make it so easy that they it's just more intuitive than them having to because once you have to put in you know set the date calendar and all those things",Need/Expectations,,
"Yes, there's a need for what happens is, you have always been independent and doing things by yourself. And now you can tell that there's something wrong, we just don't know what is wrong. And so most people do tend to withdraw and want to stay more in your rooms, or they don't want to, because now they don't want to, to be seen with your confusion in so they do tend to withdraw and want to just TV and I'm okay with TV. So the companion site does go a long way. Being able to chit chat, and it goes a long way as far as even helping reduce the depression that comes with it. So yes, that'll Yeah, that will go a long way to have a companion. Most of them. That's the the only thing is they want to withdraw, because they don't want to be seen as confused. And then they're shut out from everybody else. And sometimes the decline is much faster, just because it's not socialisation. Yeah. So that's I like, like a committee like this, when it's not like, you know, pushy, or whatever big fancy building, but at least for them to be able to come in during dinner time to talk to each other.

There is a lady, for example, this year, who's she's 102 doesn't have official admission, but we have to keep redirecting. And reminding all it's breakfast time, but I already had breakfast, sometimes you'll go and have him come back. Oh, I'm still hungry. I want to go back again. So we do have that we you know, so it's there. And part of it is part of the ageing process. You know? I mean, it's 102. I mean, he still has, yeah, it's amazing. We don't even do much for healthcare wise, particularly just now, you know, then we have a few more, a few more that, you know, we need to keep on harping and redirection, that kind of stuff. Here, the only thing is that we don't officially have that. And the reason why is for most memory care, one thing they have is insecure, who has somebody cannot just walk out. Because the most of them do in the afternoon, they do what is called wandering, they study, all of a sudden, they want to wander, they want to go home, even though that's their home, they're like now they want to go home. So a lot of them will pack and they're ready to leave. So the escape the building. So in the afternoon, the pm shift is all about looking for a missing time.

And if they're not there they come and check with the front desk or I didn't see so and so what is this one?
